5. Give us a share of strength most high, a share of strength that is below, a share of strength that is between.
6. Thou dealest gifts, resplendent One; nigh, as with waves of Sindhu, thou swift streamest to the worshipper.
7. That man is lord of endless strength whom thou protectest in the fight, Agni, or urgest to the fray.
8. Him, whosoever he may be, no man may vanquish, mighty One: nay, very glorious power is his.
9. May he who dwells with all mankind bear us with war-steeds through the fight, and with the singers win the spoil.
10. Help, thou who knowest lauds, this work, this eulogy to Rudra, him adorable in every house.
11. May this our God, great, limitless, smoke-bannered, excellently bright, urge us to strength and holy thought.
12. Like some rich Lord of men may he, Agni, the banner of the Gods, refulgent, hear us through our lauds.
13. Glory to Gods, the mighty and the lesser; glory to Gods the younger and the elder; let us, if we have power, pay the God worship.

## Hymn 1.28 – Indra and Others

1. There where the broad-based stone raised on high to press the juices out, O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.
2. Where, like broad hips, to hold the juice the platters of the press are laid, O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.
3. There where the woman marks and leans the pestle’s constant rise and fall, O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.
4. Where, as with reins to guide a horse, they bind the churning-staff with cords, O Indra, drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.
5. If of a truth in every house, O Mortar, thou art set for work, here give thou forth thy clearest sound, loud as the drum of conquerors.
6. O Sovran of the Forest, as the wind blows soft in front of thee, Mortar, for Indra press thou forth the Soma juice that he may drink.
7. Best strength-givers, ye stretch wide jaws, O Sacrificial Implements, like two bay horses champing herbs.
8. Ye Sovrans of the Forest, both swift, with swift pressers press today sweet Soma juice for Indra’s drink.
9. Take up in beakers what remains: the Soma on the filter pour, and on the ox-hide set the dregs.
