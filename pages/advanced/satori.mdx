I laud Agni, the chosen Priest,  
God, minister of sacrifice,  
The Hotar, lavishest of wealth.

Worthy is Agni to be praised  
By living as by ancient seers.  
He shall bring hitherward the Gods.

Through Agni man obtaineth wealth,  
Yea, plenty waxing day by day,  
Most rich in heroes, glorious.

Agni, the perfect sacrifice  
Which thou encompassest about,  
Verily goeth to the Gods.

May Agni, sapient-minded Priest,  
Truthful, most gloriously great,  
The God, come hither with the Gods.

Whatever blessing, Agni, thou  
Wilt grant unto thy worshipper,  
That, Angiras, is indeed thy truth.

To thee, dispeller of the night,  
O Agni, day by day with prayer,  
Bringing thee reverence, we come.

Ruler of sacrifices, guard  
Of Law eternal, radiant One,  
Increasing in thine own abode.

Be to us easy of approach,  
Even as a father to his son:  
Agni, be with us for our weal.
