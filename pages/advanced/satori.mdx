## Hymn 1.1 – Agni

1. I laud Agni, the chosen Priest, God, minister of sacrifice, the Hotar, lavishest of wealth.  
2. Worthy is Agni to be praised by living as by ancient seers; he shall bring hitherward the Gods.  
3. Through Agni man obtaineth wealth, yea, plenty waxing day by day, most rich in heroes, glorious.  
4. Agni, the perfect sacrifice which thou encompassest about, verily goeth to the Gods.  
5. May Agni, sapient-minded Priest, truthful, most gloriously great, the God, come hither with the Gods.  
6. Whatever blessing, Agni, thou wilt grant unto thy worshipper, that, Angiras, is indeed thy truth.  
7. To thee, dispeller of the night, O Agni, day by day with prayer bringing thee reverence, we come.  
8. Ruler of sacrifices, guard of Law eternal, radiant One, increasing in thine own abode.  
9. Be to us easy of approach, even as a father to his son: Agni, be with us for our weal.

## Hymn 1.2 – Vayu

1. Beautiful Vayu, come, for thee these Soma drops have been prepared: drink of them, hearken to our call.  
2. Knowing the days, with Soma juice poured forth, the singers glorify thee, Vayu, with their hymns of praise.  
3. Vayu, thy penetrating stream goes forth unto the worshipper, far-spreading for the Soma draught.  
4. These, Indra–Vayu, have been shed; come for our offered dainties’ sake: the drops are yearning for you both.  
5. Well do ye mark libations, ye Vayu and Indra, rich in spoil; so come ye swiftly hitherward.  
6. Vayu and Indra, come to what the Soma presser hath prepared: soon, Heroes, thus I make my prayer.

1. Ye Asvins, rich in treasure, Lords of splendour, having nimble hands, accept the sacrificial food.  
2. Ye Asvins, rich in wondrous deeds, ye heroes worthy of our praise, accept our songs with mighty thought.  
3. Nisatyas, wonder-workers, yours are these libations with clipt grass: come ye whose paths are red with flame.

## Hymn 1.4 – Indra

1. As a good cow to him who milks, we call the doer of fair deeds, to our assistance day by day.  
2. Come thou to our libations, drink of Soma; Soma-drinker thou! the rich One’s rapture giveth kine.  
3. So may we be acquainted with thine innermost benevolence: neglect us not, come hitherward.

3. May he stand by us in our need and in abundance for our wealth: may he come nigh us with his strength.
